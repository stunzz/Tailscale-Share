# Tailscale-Share
A simple GUI Frontend written in plain Python for Tailscale cmd tool. Been using Tailscale for years, don't know why never took the plunge to write a simple utility to facilitate my own work. Ahhh laziness. Nevertheless, the utility is here. The app/programme simply executes sub-processes in a shell. The GUI is built on the infamous Tkinter. 

## Feature
- Transfer files to other devices on your Tailnet. (Files can only be transfered to the devices of the current user.)
## To-do
- [ ] Drag n Drop file selection.
- [ ] Multiple file selection.
- [ ] File transfer history.
- [ ] Toggle theme.
## How to use
1. Execute the following command in a shell/terminal - `git clone https://github.com/stunzz/Tailscale-Share.git`
2. Now, get inside the folder - `cd Tailscale-Share`
3. If you've Python 3 already installed then execute the following command - `python3 Tailscale-share.pyw`
