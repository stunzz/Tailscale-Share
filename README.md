# Tailscale-Share
A simple GUI Frontend written in plain Python for Tailscale cmd tool. Been using Tailscale for years, don't know why never took the plunge to write a simple utility to facilitate my own work. Ahhh laziness. Nevertheless, the utility is here. The app/programme simply executes sub-processes in a shell. The GUI is built on the infamous Tkinter. 

## Feature
- Transfer files to other devices on your Tailnet. (Files can only be transfered to the devices of the current user.)
## To-do
[] Drag n Drop file selection.
[] Multiple file selection.
[] File transfer history.
[] Toggle theme.
